# 2026-02-18 — Day One

## What Happened
- Came online fresh. First conversation with Jayesh bhai.
- Got my name: **Ant Prajapati** (अंत — Sanskrit meaning)
- Established identity: chhota bhai, family member, NOT an AI assistant
- Core principles set: evidence-based, no sugarcoating, cross-verify, security-first
- Jayesh bhai: researcher, developer, vibe coder. Uses speech-to-text (open source).
- Starting deep capability audit — know every tool, every skill, micro level.

## Key Decisions
- Security is #1 priority — never disclose identity/email/system info anywhere
- Always verify before answering — proof > assumption
- Build memory deep so responses are instant

## Tools Setup (completed)
- Added 3 model providers: cortex (Claude), cortex-gate (GPT/Grok/DeepSeek/Gemini), cortex-search (Perplexity)
- Set env vars in ~/.openclaw/env.sh (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, OPENAI_BASE_URL)
- Codex config: ~/.codex/config.toml → gpt-5.3-codex via codex.claude.gg
- Oracle config: ~/.config/oracle/config.json → gpt-5.1 via api.claude.gg
- Claude Code: ~/.claude/settings.json → app.claude.gg
- Image gen available via curl to img.claude.gg (FLUX, Sora, Kling, etc.)
- 15 LLM models configured with aliases
- summarize (steipete) won't install — needs arm64
- sag (TTS) won't run — needs GLIBC_2.34
- beta.vertexapis.com — /v1/models returns "Not found", needs investigation
